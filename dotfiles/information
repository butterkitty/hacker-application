I tend to use programs to do what I need to.  I use mRemote for all 
ssh, rdp, telnet, and vnc connections I may have.  Using vmware 
workstation I can create a linux environment on the spot, which is 
what I did to download the git repo as listed on your craigslist ad.  

I have included a few of the programs I use frequently though.  
XBMC (Media Center Application) and EventGhost (x11 capable application)
is what I've been mussing around with lately and I have included 
those two config files.

If that's not good enough, I'm sorry....the rest got eaten by a tiger
